Redux DevTools
=========================

Haha. README coming. Also not on NPM yet.

In the meantime, you can do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools.git
cd redux-devtools
npm install

cd examples/counter
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

For fun, you can also open `http://localhost:3000/?debug_session=123`, click around, and then refresh.
